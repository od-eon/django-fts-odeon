django-fts-odeon is a fork of django-fts ( http://code.google.com/p/django-fts/ )
The only supported back-end is PostgreSQL

Dependencies:
- Django
- PostgreSQL

Install:
- add "FTS_BACKEND = 'pgsql://' " in settings.py and "fts" to INSTALLED_APPS
- ./manage.py migrate fts

Usage:
- subclass your model from fts.SearchableModel
- create a custom manager with the list of fields that should be indexed (CharField and TextField only)

class Blog(fts.SearchableModel):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    body = models.TextField()
    search_objects = fts.SearchManager(fields=('title', 'body')) # index both fields
    
- create FTS indices with ./manage.py create_fts_indices
- if you need to update by hand all the search indices for some reason, you can do "./manage.py update_fts_indices". Normally, the indices are always up to date because postgres takes care of them on each insert/update/delete.

- getting the results ordered by rank in postgres (the rank field's name is not important. Just avoid any clashes with existing fields):
  Blog.search_objects.search('foo bar', rank_field='rank')

- highlighting results (highlight_field is the actual model field where you want the highlighting done. The modified text will be placed in a new field called highlight_field+'_highlight'):

for blog in Blog.search_objects.search('foo bar', highlight_field='body'):
    print blog.body_highlight

- see fts_test/tests.py for more examples
